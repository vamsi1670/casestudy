install nginx and host a webpage.
Started working with RHEL 7.6 but unable to upgrade/update the epel-release packages so installed the Nginx server in Ubuntu16.04
using link "https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04"
Configured a webpage in nginx sever ,but due to organizations policies i think the webpage is not opening.

Configured an index.html page (static webpage in ) in Nginx.
The following are the steps

launch Webpage in Nginx.-------------------------------------------------------

1. install Nginx in ubuntu server.
2. by htting the ip address in the browser we can see the Nginx browsing page.
3. cahnge the directory to root. #cd /
4. Go to the folder where Nginx is installed.  
	#cd /etc/nginx/
5.change directory to sitesenabled.
	#cd sites-enabled
6. this is the directory where the nginx index.html is located
	#cd /usr/share/nginx/html 
The nginx webpage is referring to the index.html file.
7. move the directory cd /etc/nginx/nginx.conf (open this config file.)
8 Copy the old configuration file in to a new file and save.
	#mv nginx.conf nginxold.conf (either move the original conf file or copy the original file ad delete the old one.)
9.Create a new nginx.conf file and add the below lines in the file.
	
	events{
	}
	http{
		server {
			location / {
				root /data/www;
			}
		}
	}		

10. test the configuration file by using command
	#sudo nginx -t 
11. change directory cd /etc.nginx/   and reload the configuraion file.
	#sudo service nginx reload.
12. Clone the git repository in ti cd/tmp/  "git clone https://github.com/eriklinde/html5_template.git "
13 After cloning the repository move the index.html file in to cd/data/www/
	enter the ipaddress to validate the index.html is shown in the browser.
